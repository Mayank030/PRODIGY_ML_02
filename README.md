# **Customer Segmentation Using K Means Clustering**

## Problem 
Creating a K-Means CLustering Algorithm to group Customers of a Retail store based on their purchase history.


## Tools 
To implement the project we need some of the Python Libraries installed 
• Numpy
 
• Pandas 

• matplotlib

• Seaborn

• Scikit-learn 


## Implementation
1) Download the given dataset file "Mall_Customers.csv" and place it in the same directory.
2) Import the Required Pyhton Libraries.
3) The code performs the following task :
   
 Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  
 
 Perform exploratory data analysis, including data visualization using violin plots, box plots, and bar plots.  
 
 Apply K Means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation.  
 
 Visualize the clusters in a 3D scatter plot.
